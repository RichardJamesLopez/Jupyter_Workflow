# Jupyter_Workflow

This repository features several of unfinished files that I am currently working through. In cases, where I have to hide the data being used, I just put in NBA data or some other generic data. It is not uncommon for me to prototype in NBA stats as it is easier for me to illustrate points with this data.  

## Getting Started

The folders for each project should have a corresponding file to power each of the notebooks. If not, the datasource is online and called from the notebook itself.


## Prerequisites
This repository will probably be limited to basic web scrapping or data visualization files I've tinkered with in the past. For the present, it will be limited to Python.


## Installing

All of the modules used are listed in the first cells of the workbook. A running list is also below:

```
import csv
import numpy
import pandas
import holoviews
import urlopen
import BeautifulSoup
```
